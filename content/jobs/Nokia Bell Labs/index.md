- Designed an innovative approach using Inter-Class Similarity Metrics to optimize the size of Neural Network architecture. This approach compared similarities between different image class groups, ensuring enhanced efficiency in models like YOLOv5, EfficientNet, and MobileNet.
- Implemented the integration of Grad-CAM techniques with an automated graph network that allows seamless parameter grouping and facilitate Strucutral pruning to remove parameters physically. Proved instrumental in enhancing model efficiency by systematically eliminating redundant network components without compromising accuracy.
- Results of the research are submitted in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2024.
