- Conceptualized and implemented Lightweight Image Encryption Techniques for Cloud-enabled IoT Applications using Chaotic Systems.
- Analyzed and compared Tinkerbell, Duffing, Henon and Kaplan-Yorke Chaotic map for image encryption using Nosie Attack, Die Harder test, NIST test, Number of Pixel Changed Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changed Intensity (UACI) Randomness tests.
- The final encryption-decryption script using a combination of Tinkerbell and Duffing map with Chaotic Scrambling, Chaotic Swapping and Zigzag Scrambling was deployed on Raspberry Pi and Google Cloud Platform for use as a remote device and Android application respectively.
