Designed a novel Convolution Neural Network architecture to examine pictures of handwritten mathematical equations such as linear, simultaneous and quadratic and solve it, taking one character at a time using [Connected Component Analysis (CCA)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/128749.128750) algorithm for character level segmentation.
